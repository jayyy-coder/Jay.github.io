    <h2>🛠️ Project Experience</h2>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>📌 Financial Crisis Prediction: A Combined Analysis of Econometrics and Machine Learning</h3>
      <p class="date">May 2024 – Aug 2024</p>
      <p>Developed an interpretable financial crisis prediction model integrating macroeconomic indicators, international market data, and crisis labels. Applied decision trees and SVMs for model training and evaluation.<br>
      Result: Paper accepted by <a href="https://www.icmis.org/" target="_blank">ICMIS 2024 Conference</a>, to be presented in Tokyo and published in Springer’s Business and Economics series.<br>
      Co-authors: Ziqian Peng, Mengxi Liu, Jianjie Li, Rongxin Zhang

    <div class="project">
      <h3>📌 Identifying Key Indicators of Financial Crises via Classification Trees</h3>
      <p class="date">Jan 2025 – Apr 2025</p>
      <p>Analyzed macroeconomic data from 14 developed countries (1870–2008) using classification trees. Based on Schularick and Taylor (2012), modeled variables included credit, money supply, GDP, etc.<br>
      Built models in R using the rpart package; ROC and AUC confirmed high accuracy (train: 95.81%, test: 95.96%).<br>
      Findings: credgdp, loansgdp, and lrgdp were the most predictive indicators.
      </p>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>📌 Modeling Radioactive Decay using MLE and AIC Model Comparison</h3>
      <p class="date">Feb 2025 – Apr 2025</p>
      <p>Constructed mathematical models of radioactive decay using Henri (linear) and Marie (exponential) frameworks. Conducted MLE, 95% CI, residual analysis, and AIC comparison.<br>
      Result: Henri model showed better fit and stability (Henri AIC = -134.23, Marie AIC = 748.53). Explored overfitting and multicollinearity risk with Multi-Rate extensions.
      </p>

      <h3>📌 Classification Tree Modeling and Pruning</h3>
      <p class="date">Sep 2024 – Dec 2024</p>
      <p>Built classification tree models based on Titanic survival prediction. Used Gini/Entropy splitting, pruning techniques, and One Standard Error Rule via R/rpart.<br>
      Completed 30+ page report with visualizations and in-depth explanations.
      </p>
